### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm George. I have been actively coding since 2016. I started as an apprentice software developer and plan to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science in early 2023.

Early 2022 I started working on my personal website and digital garden, [georgerowlands.ch](https://github.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch). So far it has gone through two iterations:

- The first version was built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) because at the time I was using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my Digital Garden.
- The second and current version is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as it offers much more freedom and extendibility.
- Most recently the second version has been upgraded drastically by getting dockerized and receiving the ability to convert Jupyter Notebooks to markdown files.
